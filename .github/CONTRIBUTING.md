## Contributing to Resource Hub

### Reporting a bug:

Check if the bug was already reported in the [Github Issues](https://github.com/resource-hub-dev/rhub-api/issues).

If it is not there, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/resource-hub-dev/rhub-api/issues/new/choose). Make sure to follow
the template and include all relevant information.

If you want to:
* suggest some new feature/functionality to the team
* discuss some new feature/functionality you want to implement before starting the actual development
* ask any question related to features/functionalities

then please follow the appropriate template while creating the issue, and provide as much information as possible.

### Sending a pull request with a patch/feature/fix:

To send a pull request:
* Fork the project
* Make sure a bug report / feature request / question was previously opened so it can be related and validated
* Commit your changes. Please provide concise commits, with a reasonable and descriptive commit message.
* Follow the pull request template, making sure to provide as much information as needed.

Pull requests will be accepted when, and only when:
* All of the test suites are passing
* The changeset is approved by one or more team members

If the commit message(s) need to be adjusted or clarified, the team may `squash` your commits before merging.
